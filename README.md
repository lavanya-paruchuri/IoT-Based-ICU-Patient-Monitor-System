# IoT Based ICU Patient Monitoring System #

## Overview ##

The IoT Based ICU Patient Monitoring System is designed to continuously monitor critical health parameters of ICU patients, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. This data is transmitted in real-time to a web interface, allowing doctors to monitor patients remotely.

**Components**:
- Raspberry Pi: The main processing unit.
- Blood Pressure Sensor: Measures the patient's blood pressure.
- Heart Rate Sensor: Monitors the heart rate.
- Temperature Sensor: Records body temperature.
- LCD Display: Displays the readings.
- WiFi Module: Transmits data to the web interface.

**Features**:
- Real-time Monitoring: Continuously tracks vital health parameters.
- Remote Access: Allows doctors to access patient data globally through a web interface.
- Alert System: Sends alerts if any parameter goes beyond the set threshold.
